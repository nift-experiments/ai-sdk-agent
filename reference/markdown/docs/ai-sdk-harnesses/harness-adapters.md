Harness adapters connect `HarnessAgent` to a specific agent runtime. They are
the harness equivalent of AI SDK model providers: each adapter wraps one runtime
and normalizes its sessions, stream events, tools, usage, lifecycle state, and
configuration into the harness contract.

## AI SDK Harness Adapters

The AI SDK includes the following harness adapters:

- [Claude Code](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/claude-code) (`@ai-sdk/harness-claude-code`)
- [Cline](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/cline) (`@ai-sdk/harness-cline`)
- [Codex](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/codex) (`@ai-sdk/harness-codex`)
- [Cursor](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/cursor) (`@ai-sdk/harness-cursor`)
- [Deep Agents](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/deepagents) (`@ai-sdk/harness-deepagents`)
- [fx](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/fx) (`@ai-sdk/harness-fx`)
- [GitHub Copilot](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/github-copilot) (`@ai-sdk/harness-github-copilot`)
- [Grok Build](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/grok-build) (`@ai-sdk/harness-grok-build`)
- [OpenCode](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/opencode) (`@ai-sdk/harness-opencode`)
- [Pi](/providers/ai-sdk-harnesses/pi) (`@ai-sdk/harness-pi`)
