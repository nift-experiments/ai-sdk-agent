Creates a reusable AI agent capable of generating text, streaming responses, and using tools over multiple steps (a reasoning-and-acting loop). `ToolLoopAgent` is ideal for building autonomous, multi-step agents that can take actions, call tools, and reason over the results until a stop condition is reached.

Unlike single-step calls like `generateText()`, an agent can iteratively invoke tools, collect tool results, and decide next actions until completion or user approval is required.

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  tools: {
    weather: weatherTool,
    calculator: calculatorTool,
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather in NYC?',
});

console.log(result.text);
```

For agents, `runtimeContext` is the shared runtime state that flows through the
loop. For guidance on `runtimeContext`, `toolsContext`, tool `context`, and
sensitive context filtering, see [Runtime and Tool
Context](/docs/ai-sdk-core/runtime-and-tool-context).
Pass `experimental_sandbox` to `generate()` or `stream()` when tools need access to a command
or code execution environment.

## Import

```
import { ToolLoopAgent } from "ai"
```

## Constructor

### Parameters

- `model` (`LanguageModel`): The language model instance to use (e.g., from a provider).
- `instructions?` (`Instructions`): Instructions for the agent, usually used for system prompt/context.
- `allowSystemInMessages?` (`boolean`): Whether \`role: "system"\` messages are allowed in the \`prompt\` or \`messages\` fields. When unset, system messages are rejected because they can create a prompt injection attack risk. Ideally, use the \`instructions\` option instead. Set to \`true\` to allow system messages, or \`false\` to explicitly reject them.
- `tools?` (`Record<string, Tool>`): A set of tools the agent can call. Keys are tool names. Tools require the underlying model to support tool calling.
- `toolChoice?` (`ToolChoice`): Tool call selection strategy. Options: 'auto' | 'none' | 'required' | \{ type: 'tool', toolName: string }. Default: 'auto'.
- `stopWhen?` (`StopCondition | StopCondition[]`): Condition(s) for ending the agent loop. Default: isStepCount(20). Use \`isLoopFinished()\` to let the agent run until all tool calls have completed, but beware of potential runaway loops. See https\://ai-sdk.dev/v7/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/loop-finished#isloopfinished.
- `activeTools?` (`ActiveTools<TOOLS>`): Limits the tools that are available for the model to call without changing the tool call and result types in the result. All tools are active by default. Tool names are restricted to the string keys of the tool set.
- `toolOrder?` (`ToolOrder<TOOLS>`): Controls the order in which tools are sent to the provider. The list can be partial. Tools not listed in \`toolOrder\` are sent after the listed tools, sorted alphabetically. Tool names are restricted to the string keys of the tool set.
- `toolApproval?` (`ToolApprovalConfiguration<TOOLS, RUNTIME_CONTEXT>`): Approval configuration for the agent. Pass a \`GenericToolApprovalFunction\` to handle all tool calls in one callback with \`toolCall\`, \`tools\`, \`toolsContext\`, \`messages\`, and \`runtimeContext\`, or pass a per-tool object where each key can be a status (\`'not-applicable'\`, \`'approved'\`, \`'denied'\`, or \`'user-approval'\`), an object form such as \`\{ type: 'denied', reason: 'blocked by policy' }\`, or a \`SingleToolApprovalFunction\` that receives the tool input and options \`toolCallId\`, \`messages\`, \`toolContext\`, and \`runtimeContext\` (same shape as tool execution options without \`abortSignal\`, with \`context\` renamed to \`toolContext\`). The \`RUNTIME\_CONTEXT\` type parameter matches the agent's \`runtimeContext\`. A \`GenericToolApprovalFunction\` or \`SingleToolApprovalFunction\` may return \`undefined\` for the same effect as \`'not-applicable'\`. \`'not-applicable'\` is the default execution path and runs the tool without approval metadata. Use \`'approved'\`, \`'denied'\`, or their object forms when you want explicit automatic approval request/response parts in the output. Object statuses can include a \`reason\`: automatic approvals and denials forward it to the approval response, while manual user approvals forward it to the approval request for the human approver. This setting takes precedence over a tool's \`needsApproval\` default.
- `experimental_toolCallers?` (`Experimental_ToolCallers<TOOLS>`): Configures which caller tools may invoke each tool. Pass an object keyed by callee tool name whose values list caller-capable tool names. Include \`DIRECT\_TOOL\_CALL\` from \`@ai-sdk/code-mode\` to keep a configured tool directly callable by the model. Local-only callees are hidden from direct model calls and bound to their local caller for each agent step. Provider caller names are translated to provider-native allowed-caller options.
- `output?` (`Output`): Optional structured output specification, for parsing responses into typesafe data.
- `prepareStep?` (`PrepareStepFunction`): Optional function to mutate step settings or inject state for each agent step, including per-step model call settings such as temperature, maxOutputTokens, sampling controls, penalties, stop sequences, seed, and reasoning. Model call setting overrides apply only to the current step.
- `include?` (`{ requestBody?: boolean; requestMessages?: boolean; responseBody?: boolean; rawChunks?: boolean }`): Settings for controlling what data is included in step results. requestBody, requestMessages, and responseBody apply to generate(); requestBody, requestMessages, and rawChunks apply to stream().
- `repairToolCall?` (`ToolCallRepairFunction`): Optional callback to attempt automatic recovery when a tool call cannot be parsed.
- `experimental_refineToolInput?` (`ToolInputRefinement<TOOLS>`): Optional mapping of tool names to functions that refine parsed tool inputs. Each function receives the typed input for its tool and must return the same input type shape. The refined input is used for tool execution, output parts, lifecycle callbacks, and telemetry in both \`generate()\` and \`stream()\`.
- `onStart?` (`GenerateTextOnStartCallback`): Callback that is called when the agent operation begins, before any LLM calls are made. Useful for logging, analytics, or initializing state. If also specified in \`generate()\` or \`stream()\`, both callbacks are called (constructor first).
  - `GenerateTextStartEvent`

#### Returns

The `stream()` method returns a `StreamTextResult` object (see [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#returns) for details).

## Types

### `ActiveTools`

```ts
type ActiveTools<TOOLS extends ToolSet> =
  | ReadonlyArray<keyof TOOLS & string>
  | undefined;
```

Limits an agent step to the listed tool names. `undefined` means no tool restriction is applied.

### `InferAgentUIMessage`

Infers the UI message type for the given agent instance. Useful for type-safe UI and message exchanges.

#### Basic Example

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, InferAgentUIMessage } from 'ai';

const weatherAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  tools: { weather: weatherTool },
});

type WeatherAgentUIMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<typeof weatherAgent>;
```

#### Example with Message Metadata

You can provide a second type argument to customize the metadata for each message. This is useful for tracking rich metadata returned by the agent (such as createdAt, tokens, finish reason, etc.).

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, InferAgentUIMessage } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Example schema for message metadata
const exampleMetadataSchema = z.object({
  createdAt: z.number().optional(),
  model: z.string().optional(),
  totalTokens: z.number().optional(),
  finishReason: z.string().optional(),
});
type ExampleMetadata = z.infer<typeof exampleMetadataSchema>;

// Define agent as usual
const metadataAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  // ...other options
});

// Type-safe UI message type with custom metadata
type MetadataAgentUIMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<
  typeof metadataAgent,
  ExampleMetadata
>;
```

## Examples

### Basic Agent with Tools

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, isStepCount } from 'ai';
import { weatherTool, calculatorTool } from './tools';

const assistant = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  tools: {
    weather: weatherTool,
    calculator: calculatorTool,
  },
  stopWhen: isStepCount(3),
});

const result = await assistant.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather in NYC and what is 100 * 25?',
});

console.log(result.text);
console.log(result.steps); // Array of all steps taken by the agent
```

### Streaming Agent Response

```ts
const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  instructions: 'You are a creative storyteller.',
});

const stream = agent.stream({
  prompt: 'Tell me a short story about a time traveler.',
});

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### Agent with Output Parsing

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

const analysisAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  output: {
    schema: z.object({
      sentiment: z.enum(['positive', 'negative', 'neutral']),
      score: z.number(),
      summary: z.string(),
    }),
  },
});

const result = await analysisAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze this review: "The product exceeded my expectations!"',
});

console.log(result.output);
// Typed as { sentiment: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral', score: number, summary: string }
```

### Example: Approved Tool Execution

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, ModelMessage, ToolApprovalResponse, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  instructions: 'You are an agent with access to a weather API.',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72,
      }),
    }),
  },
  toolApproval: {
    weather: 'user-approval',
  },
});

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [
  { role: 'user', content: 'Is it raining in Paris today?' },
];

const result = await agent.generate({ messages });
const approvals: ToolApprovalResponse[] = [];

for (const part of result.content) {
  if (part.type === 'tool-approval-request') {
    approvals.push({
      type: 'tool-approval-response',
      approvalId: part.approvalId,
      approved: true,
    });
  }
}

messages.push(...result.responseMessages);
messages.push({ role: 'tool', content: approvals });

const approvedResult = await agent.generate({ messages });
console.log(approvedResult.text);
```
