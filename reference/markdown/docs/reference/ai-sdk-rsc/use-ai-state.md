AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK
UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) for production. For guidance on migrating from
RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui).

It is a hook that enables you to read and update the AI state. The AI state is shared globally between all `useAIState` hooks under the same `<AI/>` provider.

The AI state is intended to contain context and information shared with the AI model, such as system messages, function responses, and other relevant data.

## Import

```
import { useAIState } from "@ai-sdk/rsc"
```

## API Signature

### Returns

Similar to useState, it is an array where the first element is the current AI state and the second element is a function to update the state.
