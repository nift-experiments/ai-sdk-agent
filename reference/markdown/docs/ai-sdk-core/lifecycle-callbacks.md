Event callbacks let you run your own code at important points in an AI SDK call.
You can attach them directly to `generateText`, `streamText`, `embed`, `embedMany`, `rerank`, and `experimental_decide` calls to observe what happened, record usage, debug multi-step generations, and monitor tool execution.

They are especially useful when you want application-specific logic close to the call site:

- Log which model, prompt shape, and settings were used for a request.
- Record token usage, latency, finish reasons, and warnings for analytics or billing.
- Understand how a multi-step tool call moved from model response to tool execution to final answer.
- Track tool inputs, tool outputs, execution time, and errors.
- Attach your own request, user, tenant, or workflow identifiers through `runtimeContext` and `toolsContext`.

For automatic OpenTelemetry instrumentation across your application, use [Telemetry](/docs/ai-sdk-core/telemetry).
Use event callbacks when you want to run custom code for a specific AI SDK call.

## Basic Usage

Pass callbacks as options to the AI SDK function you are calling:

```tsx {8-18}
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',

  onStart({ callId, modelId }) {
    console.log('Generation started', { callId, modelId });
  },

  onEnd({ callId, usage, finishReason }) {
    console.log('Generation finished', {
      callId,
      finishReason,
      totalTokens: usage.totalTokens,
    });
  },
});
```

Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous. If a callback throws, the error is caught internally and the AI SDK call continues.
Because callbacks run as part of the lifecycle, keep them fast or enqueue expensive work in a background system.

## Use Cases

### Request Logging

Use `onStart` and `onEnd` to record one application log for the beginning and end of a call.
The `callId` is available across lifecycle events, so you can correlate logs from the same request.

```tsx {8-23}
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  prompt: 'Write a short product description for a camping mug.',

  onStart({ callId, provider, modelId }) {
    logger.info('ai.request.started', {
      callId,
      provider,
      modelId,
    });
  },

  onEnd({ callId, finishReason, usage, warnings }) {
    logger.info('ai.request.finished', {
      callId,
      finishReason,
      usage,
      warningCount: warnings?.length ?? 0,
    });
  },
});
```

This pattern works well for audit logs, internal dashboards, and tracking usage for a particular feature.

### Measuring Model Performance

`onLanguageModelCallEnd` runs after a provider response has been normalized and parsed.
For `streamText`, the event also includes streaming-specific timing data such as time to first output and gaps between output chunks.

```tsx {8-19}
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  prompt: 'Explain partial prerendering in two paragraphs.',

  onLanguageModelCallEnd({
    callId,
    modelId,
    usage,
    performance,
    providerMetadata,
  }) {
    metrics.histogram('ai.model.response_time_ms', performance.responseTimeMs, {
      callId,
      modelId,
    });

    metrics.gauge('ai.model.tokens_per_second', {
      output: performance.outputTokensPerSecond,
      total: performance.effectiveTotalTokensPerSecond,
      tokens: usage.totalTokens,
    });

    logger.info('ai.model.provider_metadata', {
      callId,
      providerMetadata,
    });
  },
});

for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}
```

Use model-call events when you want to measure provider work specifically.
Use step events when you want timing that includes SDK-managed work such as local tool execution.

### Debugging Multi-Step Tool Calls

When you use tools with `generateText` or `streamText`, a single user request can involve multiple model calls.
Each model call is a step. The model may call a tool in one step, receive the tool result, and then produce a final answer in the next step.

```tsx {17-31}
import { generateText, isStepCount, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateText({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  stopWhen: isStepCount(5),
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => getWeather(location),
    }),
  },

  onStepStart({ stepNumber, messages, steps }) {
    console.log(`Step ${stepNumber} started`, {
      messageCount: messages.length,
      previousSteps: steps.length,
    });
  },

  onStepEnd({ stepNumber, finishReason, toolCalls, usage, performance }) {
    console.log(`Step ${stepNumber} finished`, {
      finishReason,
      toolCalls: toolCalls.map(toolCall => toolCall.toolName),
      totalTokens: usage.totalTokens,
      stepTimeMs: performance.stepTimeMs,
    });
  },
});
```

This helps answer questions such as:

- Did the model call a tool or answer directly?
- How many steps did the request take?
- Which step used the most tokens?
- Did time go to the model response or to local tool execution?

### Monitoring Tool Execution

Tool execution callbacks run around the tool's `execute` function.
Use them to record tool usage, latency, successful results, and tool errors.

```tsx {19-36}
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateText({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  prompt: 'Find flights from SFO to JFK tomorrow morning.',
  tools: {
    searchFlights: tool({
      description: 'Search available flights',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        origin: z.string(),
        destination: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async input => searchFlights(input),
    }),
  },

  onToolExecutionStart({ callId, toolCall }) {
    logger.info('ai.tool.started', {
      callId,
      toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
      toolName: toolCall.toolName,
      input: toolCall.input,
    });
  },

  onToolExecutionEnd({ callId, toolCall, toolExecutionMs, toolOutput }) {
    logger.info('ai.tool.finished', {
      callId,
      toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
      toolName: toolCall.toolName,
      durationMs: toolExecutionMs,
      success: toolOutput.type === 'tool-result',
    });
  },
});
```

`toolOutput` is a discriminated union. When `toolOutput.type` is `'tool-result'`, the output is available on `toolOutput.output`. When it is `'tool-error'`, the error is available on `toolOutput.error`.

### Observing Embeddings and Reranking

Embedding and reranking callbacks are simpler: they expose `onStart` and `onEnd` around the operation.
This is useful for retrieval pipelines where you want to understand how often you are embedding, how many values you embed, and how reranking changes result sets.

```tsx {10-24,32-37}
import { embedMany, rerank } from 'ai';
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';

const values = ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'];

const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  values,

  onStart({ callId, operationId, modelId, value }) {
    logger.info('ai.embedding.started', {
      callId,
      operationId,
      modelId,
      valueCount: Array.isArray(value) ? value.length : 1,
    });
  },

  onEnd({ callId, usage }) {
    logger.info('ai.embedding.finished', {
      callId,
      tokens: usage.tokens,
    });
  },
});

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v4.0-pro'),
  documents: values,
  query: 'talk about rain',

  onEnd({ callId, ranking }) {
    logger.info('ai.rerank.finished', {
      callId,
      topResult: ranking[0],
    });
  },
});
```

## Generation Lifecycle

`generateText` and `streamText` expose the richest lifecycle because they can involve prompts, model calls, tool calls, and multiple steps.

A typical single-step generation runs in this order:

1. `onStart`
2. `onStepStart`
3. `onLanguageModelCallStart`
4. `onLanguageModelCallEnd`
5. `onStepEnd`
6. `onEnd`

A multi-step generation with local tool execution usually runs like this:

1. `onStart`
2. `onStepStart`
3. `onLanguageModelCallStart`
4. `onLanguageModelCallEnd`
5. `onToolExecutionStart`
6. `onToolExecutionEnd`
7. `onStepEnd`
8. Repeat step callbacks until the stop condition is met
9. `onEnd`

`onStepStart` and `onStepEnd` describe the full step.
`onLanguageModelCallStart` and `onLanguageModelCallEnd` describe only the model call inside that step.
This distinction matters when the step includes local tool execution: the step duration can be longer than the model response duration.

## Runtime and Tool Context

Generation and step lifecycle callbacks receive the full `runtimeContext` and
`toolsContext` values that flow through the call. Tool-execution callbacks receive
the scoped `toolContext` for the tool being executed. This makes callbacks useful
for attaching application context without changing prompts or tool inputs.

```tsx {8-24,26-39}
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateText({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5",
  prompt: 'Check the order status.',
  runtimeContext: {
    requestId: 'req_123',
    tenantId: 'tenant_abc',
  },
  tools: {
    getOrderStatus: tool({
      inputSchema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),
      contextSchema: z.object({ region: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ orderId }, { context }) =>
        getOrderStatus(orderId, context.region),
    }),
  },
  toolsContext: {
    getOrderStatus: {
      region: 'us-east-1',
    },
  },

  onStart({ callId, runtimeContext }) {
    logger.info('ai.request.started', {
      callId,
      requestId: runtimeContext.requestId,
      tenantId: runtimeContext.tenantId,
    });
  },

  onToolExecutionStart({ toolCall, toolContext }) {
    logger.info('ai.tool.started', {
      toolName: toolCall.toolName,
      region: toolContext.region,
    });
  },
});
```

Telemetry integrations can filter `runtimeContext` and `toolsContext` before
exporting them. Generation and step callbacks receive the full context
objects; tool-execution callbacks receive scoped tool context. Be careful not
to log secrets or sensitive user data from callbacks.
