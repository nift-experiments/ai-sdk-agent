AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK
UI](/v5/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) for production. For guidance on migrating from
RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](/v5/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui).

Creates a client-server context provider that can be used to wrap parts of your application tree to easily manage both UI and AI states of your application.

## Import

```
import { createAI } from "@ai-sdk/rsc"
```

## API Signature

### Parameters

- `actions` (`Record<string, Action>`): Server side actions that can be called from the client.
- `initialAIState` (`any`): Initial AI state to be used in the client.
- `initialUIState` (`any`): Initial UI state to be used in the client.
- `onGetUIState` (`() => UIState`): is called during SSR to compare and update UI state.
- `onSetAIState` (`(Event) => void`): is triggered whenever an update() or done() is called by the mutable AI state in your action, so you can safely store your AI state in the database.
  - `Event`
    - `state` (`AIState`): The resulting AI state after the update.
    - `done` (`boolean`): Whether the AI state updates have been finalized or not.

### Returns

It returns an `<AI/>` context provider.
